# Classic Seafood Pie

## Ingredients

For the Filling:
- 1 pound mixed seafood (such as cod, shrimp, scallops), cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (such as peas, carrots, corn), thawed if frozen
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup seafood or vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup white wine (optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste

For the Pastry:
- 1 package store-bought puff pastry sheets, thawed
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

## Instructions
**Prepare the Filling**
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven according to the puff pastry package instructions.
2. In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and saut√© until translucent.
3. Sprinkle the flour over the onion and garlic, and stir to create a paste (roux). Cook for 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.
4. Gradually whisk in the milk, seafood or vegetable broth, and white wine (if using). Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens and becomes smooth.
5. Add the diced potatoes to the sauce and simmer until they start to soften, about 5-7 minutes. Add the mixed vegetables and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
6. Stir in the mixed seafood pieces and chopped parsley. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the seafood is just cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let the filling cool slightly.
**Assemble**
1. Roll out one sheet of puff pastry and line a pie dish with it. Trim any excess pastry hanging over the edges. Pour the slightly cooled seafood filling into the pie crust.
2. Roll out the second sheet of puff pastry and place it over the filling. Press the edges of the two pastry sheets together to seal the pie. Use a fork to crimp the edges and create a decorative border.
3. Brush the top of the pastry with beaten egg to create a golden crust. Use a sharp knife to make a few small slits in the center of the pastry to allow steam to escape.
4. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about **25-30 minutes**, or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.
5. Allow the seafood pie to cool slightly before slicing and serving. Garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired.
