## Cranberry Glazed Brussels Sprouts

## Ingredients

- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved
- 1/2 cup cranberry sauce (homemade or store-bought)
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley or thyme, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare Brussels Sprouts**: In a large mixing bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper until well coated.

3. **Roast Brussels Sprouts**: Spread the Brussels sprouts evenly on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender and slightly caramelized, tossing them halfway through for even cooking.

4. **Prepare Glaze**: In a small saucepan, combine the cranberry sauce, balsamic vinegar, and brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is well combined and slightly reduced, about 5-7 minutes.

5. **Glaze the Brussels Sprouts**: Once the Brussels sprouts are roasted, drizzle the cranberry glaze over them. Toss gently to coat the sprouts with the glaze.

6. **Return to Oven**: Place the glazed Brussels sprouts back in the oven for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the glaze has slightly caramelized and the sprouts are coated with a shiny glaze.

7. **Serve**: Transfer the cranberry glazed Brussels sprouts to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or thyme, if desired.
