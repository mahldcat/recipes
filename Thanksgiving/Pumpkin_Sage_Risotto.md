# Pumpkin Sage Risotto

## Ingredients:
* 2 cups Arborio rice
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 6 cups vegetable broth, kept warm
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for a non-vegan version)
* 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves, chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions:
1. Prepare Ingredients: Heat the vegetable broth in a separate pot and keep it warm over low heat. In a large skillet or wide saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2. Sauté Aromatics: Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Toast Rice: Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the rice is lightly toasted.
4. Deglaze with Wine: Pour in the white wine and stir until it's mostly absorbed by the rice.
5. Start Adding Broth: Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladleful at a time, to the rice. Stir constantly and allow the broth to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to your desired level of doneness. This usually takes about 18-20 minutes.
6. Incorporate Pumpkin: Stir in the pumpkin puree to the risotto, mixing it well to create a rich and creamy texture.
7. Add Sage: Fold in the chopped sage leaves, reserving a few for garnish.
8 Finish and Season: If using, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese to add creaminess to the risotto. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep in mind that the cheese will also add saltiness.
