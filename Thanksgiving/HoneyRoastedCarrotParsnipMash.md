# Honey-Roasted Carrot and Parsnip Mash

## Ingredients
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2-3 tablespoons butter (or olive oil), for mashing
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)

# Instructions
1. Preheat Oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Place the carrot and parsnip chunks on a baking sheet. Drizzle with honey and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss well to coat the vegetables evenly.
3. Roast the carrots and parsnips in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until they are tender and caramelized. You can flip them halfway through the roasting time for even caramelization.
4. Once the roasted carrots and parsnips are done, transfer them to a mixing bowl. Add the butter (or olive oil) to the warm vegetables. Use a potato masher or a fork to mash the vegetables until you achieve your desired level of smoothness. If you prefer a chunkier texture, mash them less; for a smoother texture, mash more.
5. Taste the mash and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper, if needed.
