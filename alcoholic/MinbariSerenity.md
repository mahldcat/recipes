**Tasting Notes:**

Minbari Serenity is a harmonious and contemplative cocktail inspired by the Minbari culture. The lavender-infused gin provides a calming foundation, reminiscent of Minbari meditation and introspection. The elderflower liqueur adds a subtle floral complexity, while the green tea syrup imparts a sense of wisdom and serenity. The touch of citrus from the lemon juice brightens the flavors, and the orange peel twist releases a delicate aroma.
